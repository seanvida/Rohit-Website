            Goa is not a place, but an emotion. This is how conversation brew in and around India: Hey! It's my birthday- Should we go to Goa?, Bro- getting bored, can we do Goa?, I want to get married - can we choose destination de Goa?
            This is one place full of party spots, shacks on the beach playing osme real good music, cafes serving some really nice multi cultural food. Goa has and carries something for each of us.

            South Goa known for its relaxing vibes, grooves of coconut giving you respite from the chimney hot sun, take a spot at one of the shacks by the beach- see the waves take big heights and then wash away in the moist sand. Lie down, unwind and breath- South Goa is a do-nothing and yet do it all place. Naturally crafted with Palolem beach, Cola beach, Agonda beach, it's a beautiful place to take a break at.

      Oh, you beauty! The words are still etched in my head, till date, these were the words that i uttered the moment I travelled few kilometeres ahead of Assam-Meghalaya into the lush green state of Shillong, I could truly appreciate the naturaly beauty of Meghalaya.
      The unforgettable landscapes of Meghalaya will stay in your heart, long after your journey is over. The table-top heights of Sohra (Cherrapunjee) are brimful with waterfalls, streams, and forest trails. Gaze at the Bangladeshi plains from the many vantage points on the state’s southern ridges.
