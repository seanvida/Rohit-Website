            Bir has my heart, and my mind. One of my personal favorites and go to place for a quick break. A small town amidst the himalyan ranges- Bir is a tibetan refugee settlemnt and that is also an invitation to some warm, love soaked bowl of Thupka with a plate full of juicy, full of spices, steaming momos. <br />
          While Bir enjoys it's fair share of love for the comfort food, it's also the most famous location for paragliding in India. I enjoyed flying high at a thrilling height of 8200 ft. with a bird's eye view of this beautiful village          </p>

    Pristine, pious and the village of pure air- that is how I see Tosh. Tosh is untouched by modernisation and fast-paced life. With its gradual terrain and the waters of river Parvati flowing through its bosom, the Tosh Kasol trek is the go-to expedition for all adrenaline junkies. The hippie culture and otherworldly vibe of this village will surely transport you to another world.

      My go-to spot for nature, tibetan food and some motorbike adventure. Known as Little Lhasa and famous around the world for being home to the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, Mcleod Ganj is a beautiful town situated near upper Dharamsala. Nestled amidst majestic hills and lush greenery, this town is culturally blessed by a prominent Tibetan influence owing to the major settlement of Tibetans here. Mcleodganj has one of the most mesmerising landscapes in the entire state of Himachal Pradesh and attracts a lot of tourists throughout the year

      Rishikesh is the yoga capital of the world. Famous for it's asharams that run programmes for yoga, meditation and spirtuality, Rishikesh has come a very long way to be the confluence of ancient knowledge being used to solve modern world problems. My place for some spirituality, some white water rafting and some solace.
