      <p>
        While I have read hundreds of books thus far, but there are some jewels which had lasting impact on me and are dear to me. From being averse to reading naything beyond academics to have developed a liking for reading anything and everything, my reading journey has evolved alot. Offlate, my personal interest lies more towards human psychology, behaviours and learning the historical evolution of some of the pressed nations of the world i.e Tibet, Myanmmar, Vietnam etc.
