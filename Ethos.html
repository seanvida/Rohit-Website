          112 Meditations- A book by Ranjit Chaudhary is what led me to explore the crossroads of meditation! The word which was going viral in the west despite it having ancient grounds in the Indian subcontinent. I started meditating for the mere sake of exploration but soon it started unfolding it's magic. I felt calmer in tough times, I felt more assured and started appreciating smaller milestones of life while feeling a lot more content. There is a saying, which I had read somewhere, reading 3 books on any topic places you in top 2% of people well aware of the subject. My curiosity led me to delve further on this subject, today I feel I undersatnd all benefits and trade-offs you'd be able to appreciate while practicing meditation and I keep practicing it at my own will. üßò

          Travel has a lot of connotations for me- it broadens perspectives, exposes you to new things, makes you happy,  etches some forever to be lived memories for you and makes you meet new people! ü•Ç
          Some of my best experiences are already captured in the section <a href="photography.html">Travel Tales</a><br />.
          2023 has South East Asia in the ques for me- For the cosmpolitan and flourishing economy of Singapore, and for the exploratory terrains of Indonesia, to learn from people on what Vietnam war really meant for the families of those millions of people impacted, and for rejoicing the tropical Thailand. üå¥üçπ

          This is the fuel that drives me everyday. A happy dose of workout early in the morning is all I need to seize the day. From being overweight to sheeding those extra kilos, I have learned the value of fitness while on the journey and ensure I minimise digressions! üòÑ

          My ethos are about aiming big, achieving some and failing in a few but moving forward. I am more missionary by nature and like to keep challenging the status quo to lead to personal betterment. The challenegs could mean what I do on personal health front or it could mean the kind of travel I choose, or the resolution I set for myself to achieve: to learn or to grow on any axis of dimension.

          <b><u>Philosophy of life-</u></b><br />
          I belive the end purpose of everything is happiness. Happiness is what leads to contentment and contentment gives you a sense of balance and wellbeing. For me happiness comes from harmony in the following pursuits:
          Health, Finances, Relationships, Career, Learning. As long as all the things are equally prioritised, there is no reason of seeking happiness elsewhere.
