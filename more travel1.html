Madikeri or more famously known as Coorg is the prime hill station of Southern India. It has a very nice and peculiar vibe to it. The entire terrain is full of misty hills overlooking multiple brooks and waterfalls. A go-to place for any nature lover. My trip here was exploring the town in an out on a motorbike, meeting people, relishing local food and brewing conversations over a cup of hot filter coffee!
